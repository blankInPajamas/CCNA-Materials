Switches have 24 interfaces or ports to connect end hosts like PCs. 

RJ-45 = Registered Jack
- Used on the end of copper network cable

Ethernet:
- Collection of network protocols/standards

Why do we need network protocols/standards?
- Need a common language

Bits and Bytes:
- Bits are represented by 0s and 1s
- When communicating across a copper network cable, a variation in electrical signal is interpreted by the received end as a 0 or 1. 
- Byte is a series of 8 bits.
- **Speed is measured in bits per second, because data is transmitted serially over the internet (Kbps, Mbps, Gbps, etc), not bytes per second.**

- 1 kilo bit(Kb) = 1,000 bits
- 1 megabit(Mb) = 1,000,000 bits
- 1 gigabit(Gb) = 1,000,000,000 bits
- 1 terabit (Tb) = 1,000,000,000,000 bits

Ethernet Standards:
- Defined in IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer)

| Speed    | Common Name      | IEEE Standard | Informal Name | Maximum Length |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| 10 Mbps  | Ethernet         |               |               |                |
| 100 Mbps | Fast Ethernet    |               |               |                |
| 1 Gbps   | Gigabit Ethernet |               |               |                |
| 10 Gbps  | 10 Gig Ethernet  |               |               |                |
