Switches have 24 interfaces or ports to connect end hosts like PCs. 

RJ-45 = Registered Jack
- Used on the end of copper network cable

Ethernet:
- Collection of network protocols/standards

Why do we need network protocols/standards?
- Need a common language

Bits and Bytes:
- Bits are represented by 0s and 1s
- When communicating across a copper network cable, a variation in electrical signal is interpreted by the received end as a 0 or 1. 
- Byte is a series of 8 bits.
- **Speed is measured in bits per second, because data is transmitted serially over the internet (Kbps, Mbps, Gbps, etc), not bytes per second.**
